\title{PLACEHOLDER for comb_TA}
\usage{
comb_TA(x, trim_factor = NULL, criterion = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class 'foreccomb'. Contains training set (actual values + matrix of model forecasts) and optionally a test set.}

\item{trim_factor}{Trim factor to be used.}

\item{criterion}{If no trim factor is specified, an optimization criterion for automatized trimming needs to be defined.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class 'foreccomb_res'
\itemize{
\item Method Returns the used forecast combination method.
\item Models Returns the individual input models that were used for the forecast combinations.
\item Weights Returns the combination weights obtained by applying the combination method to the training set.
\item Fitted Returns the fitted values of the combination method for the training set.
\item Accuracy_Train Returns range of summary measures of the forecast accuracy for the training set.
\item Forecasts_Test Returns forecasts produced by the combination method for the test set. Only returned if input included a forecast matrix for the test set.
\item Accuracy_Test Returns range of summary measures of the forecast accuracy for the test set. Only returned if input included a forecast matrix and a vector of actual values for the test set.

\description{
Computes forecast combination weights according to the standard eigenvector approach by Hsiao and Wan (2014) and produces forecasts for the test set, if provided.
}
\details{
The standard eigenvector approach retrieves combination weights from the sample estimated mean squared prediction error matrix
as follows:
The results are stored in an object of class 'foreccomb_res', for which separate plot and summary functions are provided.

\examples{
obs <- rnorm(100)
preds <- matrix(rnorm(1000, 1), 100, 10)
train_o<-obs[1:80]
train_p<-preds[1:80,]
test_o<-obs[81:100]
test_p<-preds[81:100,]

data<-foreccomb(train_o, train_p, test_o, test_p)
